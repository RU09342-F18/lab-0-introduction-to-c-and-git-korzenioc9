Implemented in C is a basic calculator capable of performing the following functions:
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Modulus / Remainder (%)
- Shift Left (<)
- Shift Right (>)
- Bitwise AND (&)
- Bitwise OR (|)
- Bitwise XOR (^)
- Bitwise Inverse (~)

The calculator uses char to take the operator input.
The calculator takes two numerical inputs that are implemented as integers (int).

The switch function allows the program to selectively execute one case only based on user input.
